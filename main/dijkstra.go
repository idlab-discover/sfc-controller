/*
Package dijkstra is an highly optimised implementation of the Dijkstra
algorithm, used for find the shortest path between points of a graph.

A graph is a map of points and map to the neighbouring points in the graph and
the cost to reach them.
A trivial example of a graph definition is:

	Graph{
		"a": {"b": 10, "c": 20},
		"b": {"a": 50},
		"c": {"b": 10, "a": 25},
	}
